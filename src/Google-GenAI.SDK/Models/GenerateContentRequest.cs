A `Tool` is a piece of code that enables the system to interact with external systems to perform an action, or set of actions, outside of knowledge and scope of the `Model`. Supported `Tool`s are `Function` and `code_execution`. Refer to the [Function calling](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling) and the [Code execution](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/code-execution) guides to learn more.

    /// Optional. A list of unique `SafetySetting` instances for blocking unsafe content.  This will be enforced on the `GenerateContentRequest.contents` and `GenerateContentResponse.candidates`. There should not be more than one setting for each `SafetyCategory` type. The API will block any contents and responses that fail to meet the thresholds set by these settings. This list overrides the default settings for each `SafetyCategory` specified in the safety_settings. If there is no `SafetySetting` for a given `SafetyCategory` provided in the list, the API will use the default safety setting for that category. Harm categories HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH, HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT, HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT, HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT, HARM_CATEGORY_CIVIC_INTEGRITY are supported. Refer to the [guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings) for detailed information on available safety settings. Also refer to the [Safety guidance](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-guidance) to learn how to incorporate safety considerations in your AI applications.
